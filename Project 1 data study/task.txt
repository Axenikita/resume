TASK:
You have been provided with a dataset containing information about requests (rows in the table) for a specific period of time (see the attached Excel file "Test sample").
During the provided time frame, there was a decrease in conversion to completed requests, which negatively impacted the company's revenue.
It is necessary to understand the reasons behind this decline and find the "root cause" of the problem.

To accomplish the task, you need to first transfer the entire dataset into a database (imagine you are working with a real SQL table) and then work with the SQL table.
Also, create a report in Power BI and visually display the following:
• The number of requests broken down by days, weeks, and months (these should be hierarchies).
• The Completed rate metric.
• A table (matrix) broken down by days, where the relationships of up_stage, mid_stage, page_status, sub_stage to the number of requests are hierarchically displayed (see the screenshot below as an example).

Based on the Power BI report, the following conclusions were drawn:

Conversion sharply deteriorated on May 20th and remained low until the 22nd and 23rd, after which it returned to previous levels.
Simultaneously with this decline in conversion, the total number of requests decreased, as the accumulation of unfulfilled requests prevented the emergence of new ones.
The reason for the decline in conversion is the change in the structure of requests (up_stage). The share of the Personal Details category sharply increased, which had zero conversion, and the share of Bank Verification requests sharply decreased, which had 100% conversion. Additionally, the share of KYS Detail decreased, but their conversion rate increased, so the effect on the overall conversion was minimal.
The conversion of other up stages changed, but this did not affect the overall result.
